# SentiCare
Voice-Based Mental Health Support System (FYP)

## Project Overview
SentiCare is a voice-based AI system under development aimed at supporting mental health. The system will eventually detect emotions from a user’s voice and provide supportive responses through a chatbot interface.

**Current Status:** Planning and setup stage. The 15-day mini toy model is the next step to validate the concept.

---

## Objectives
- Build a proof-of-concept voice emotion detection system.  
- Integrate basic chatbot responses based on detected emotions.  
- Create a clean project structure for future expansion.  
- Plan for scalability: multiple emotions, larger datasets, and clinical validation.  

---

## Planned Features
- **Voice Emotion Detection:** Analyze pitch, tone, and basic audio features.  
- **Chatbot Integration:** Supportive responses for different emotional states.  
- **Modular & Scalable:** Designed to easily add more features and datasets.

## Next Steps
1. **Setup Environment:** Python virtual environment, required libraries.  
2. **Collect Sample Voice Data:** Small dataset of basic emotions (anxious, happy, neutral).  
3. **Build Mini Toy Model:** Voice → Feature extraction → Emotion classification → Chatbot response.  
4. **Evaluate Feasibility:** Decide whether to expand in Urdu or focus on English datasets.
